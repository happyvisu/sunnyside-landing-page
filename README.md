## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

Use of  HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. 

Try to create both a mobile and a desktop version of the design present in 'design/' folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I always looking to improve my coding skills . So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please write.
